/**
 * Aggregates the metrics of PRD 10.2 over a time window, from the stored rows.
 *
 * <p>The window is half open, {@code [from, to)}. When a bound is not given it is filled in rather
 * than left implicit: a missing {@code to} means "up to now", a missing {@code from} means
 * {@value #DEFAULT_WINDOW_MINUTES} minutes before the upper bound. The resolved window is echoed back
 * in the result so a caller can tell which numbers it actually asked for.
 *
 * <p>Peak values (for example the peak backlog) are not derivable from one aggregate, so this
 * service reports point in time readings and the experiment samples them.
