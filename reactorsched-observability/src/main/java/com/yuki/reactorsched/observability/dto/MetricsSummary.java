/**
 * Metric summary of a time window, computed from the {@code task} and {@code task_execution} rows
 * themselves (PRD 10.2). Nothing here is estimated: every number is an aggregate over stored rows.
 *
 * <p>Definitions are fixed here so two readings of the same window mean the same thing:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code completedTasks} counts tasks that reached a terminal state inside the window
 *       ({@code SUCCEEDED} + {@code FAILED}); {@code CANCELLED} is reported separately and is not
 *       part of the failure rate.</li>
 *   <li>{@code failureRate} = {@code failedTasks} / {@code completedTasks}, or {@code 0} when the
 *       window completed nothing. The denominator is stated so the number cannot be read as
 *       "failures per submission".</li>
 *   <li>{@code throughputPerSecond} = {@code succeededTasks} / window length in seconds.</li>
 *   <li>{@code avgQueueDelayMs} = average of (attempt {@code started_at} - task {@code created_at})
 *       over attempts started in the window.</li>
 *   <li>{@code avgExecutionDelayMs} = average of (attempt {@code finished_at} - {@code started_at})
 *       over attempts finished in the window.</li>
 *   <li>{@code avgAttemptsPerTask} = attempts started in the window / distinct tasks attempted in
 *       the window; it is the "logical task to attempt" ratio of PRD 10.2.</li>
 *   <li>{@code backlogNow} and {@code runningNow} are point in time readings at query time. A peak
 *       backlog cannot be derived from one reading, so callers that need it sample this endpoint.</li>
 * </ul>
