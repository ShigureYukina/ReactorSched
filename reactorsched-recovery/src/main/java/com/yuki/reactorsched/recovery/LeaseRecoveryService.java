/**
 * One pass of the recovery scanner: tasks whose executor disappeared are put back into the dispatch
 * flow, and attempts that were left open are closed.
 *
 * <p>The scanner itself is stateless and safe to run on several workers at the same time: every
 * decision is applied with a conditional update, so at most one scanner wins per task.
